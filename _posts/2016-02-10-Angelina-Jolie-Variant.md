My facination with quantitative genetics can be explained with a simple example. We know that particular variants
within the *Brca1* gene most certainly increase one's chances of developing breast cancer and/or ovarian caner.
To a statistical geneticist, these variants have a **"large effect"**, in that if you possess them, you
most likely or most certainly will develop the trait/disease. However, variants such as those Angelina Jolie Pitt
caries within her *Brca1* gene are said to contribute very little to the **genetic variance**
of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.

What does that mean? Well if a sample of breast cancer patients are studied, you will find that most
of them do not possess the same mutations that Angelina Jolie has in her *Brca1*
gene. Actually, mutations like Angelina's only account for ~2% of breast cancer patients, so you could
say that the *Brca1* mutation, however important, reveals only a small portion of the breast cancer mystery.
Therefore, it is not just the **effect size** of a variant that determines the variance it contributes
to a trait, but the frequency that it occurs within a population.

Whereas molecular genetics can be used to discover a handful of large effect loci, and thereby provide valuable
knowledge that can contribute to the design of genetic therapies for those that have mutations at those loci, 
it is quantitative genetics that has potential to reveal the full picture of complex traits, albeit at the cost of understanding
less of the molecular basis of the pathogenesis.
