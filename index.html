            <p>A site dedicated to my academic accomplishments and blog posts detailing my journey learning quantitative genetics, R, C++, and web development. I enjoy pondering questions in genomics and learning new statistical/CS/web techniques to enhance my research. "Computational biologists" have great opportunities to learn new skills, languages, and workflow practices to not only make their research easier, but incredibly fun. When not having fun with research and coding, I enjoy Seattle sports teams, good coffee, and good beer.</p>
