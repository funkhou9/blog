            <p>Thankfully, free from the bench to learn bioinformatics. This site includes blog posts detailing my journey with quantitative genetics, R, C++, and web development. I enjoy pondering questions in genomics and learning new statistical/CS/web techniques to enhance my research. "Computational biologists" are a privaliged bunch, with opportunities to learn to skills, languages, and workflow practices to not only make their research easier, but incredibly fun. When not having fun with research and coding, I enjoy Seattle sports teams, good coffee, and good beer.</p>
